Some settings for running krobot executable automatically on the robot
Only tested with remote on
all the libs where copied to /opt/naoqi/lib as in the nao start scipts this is the pwd
config folder was copied to /opt/naoqi/bin dont ask it just worked this is the curdir of /opt/naoqi/bin/naoqi scripts internal pwd

in the crossbuilding for remote module
the setings where

  ActivityBuildType                SHARED
  ExternalSrcsBldType              SHARED
  KROBOT_IS_REMOTE                 ON
  LibBuildType                     STATIC
  TargetPlatform                   robot



p.s. this was a nice command when runned under crossbuild folder
 find ./ -iname  '*.so' -exec cp {} ~/Desktop/libs/ \;
then this where copied to /opt/naoqi/lib
